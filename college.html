Shortlisting takes into account CAT section-wise performance along with weightage for past academics. The final selection typically considers 10th and 12th marks, CAT performance, a discussion on a Statement of Purpose, an extempore round, and a personal interview. The process is highly competitive, with cut-offs usually in the high 90s percentile range and a limited number of seats relative to the applicant pool.',

The total academic fee for the full two-year MBA is around ₹2.4 lakh, which is significantly lower than most top Indian B-schools. When this modest fee is compared with recent average salary figures in the mid-₹30 LPA range, FMS consistently emerges as one of the best-value management programs in the country for aspirants focused on ROI.',

It has been ranked among the top 10 MBA institutes in multiple national rankings and consistently features just behind the leading IIMs on most lists.
